This post assumes familiarity with basic Deep Learning concepts like Multi-layered Perceptrons, Convolution Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Transfer Learning, Gradient Descent, Backpropagation, Overfitting, Probability, Text Processing, Python syntax and data structures, Keras library, etc.
Using Flickr8k dataset
Used Keras with Tensorflow backend for the code. InceptionV3 is used for extracting the features.
